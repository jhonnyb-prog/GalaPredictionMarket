### Initial Plan — 2025-09-24 12:34:40 PDT
1. Review project documentation and configuration to map architecture and trust boundaries.
2. Assess third-party dependencies for security risks.
3. Inspect server-side code for auth, validation, and data handling weaknesses.
4. Evaluate client-side security posture and secret handling.
5. Audit shared utilities, build, and deployment practices; summarize findings and next steps.

### Update — 2025-09-24 12:34:50 PDT
- Step 1 completed; findings logged in `codex_findings.md` (architecture mapped, trust boundaries noted).
- Step 2 completed; dependency risks documented and remediation tasks identified.
- Step 3 completed; server-side auth/validation gaps and logging issues captured.
- Step 4 completed; client-side spoofing/admin exposure and CSRF concerns recorded.
- Step 5 completed; deployment/build hardening items prioritized and next actions outlined.
